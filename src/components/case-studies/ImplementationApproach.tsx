          To create a seamless platform for car rentals and issue reporting,
          DASGUZO focused on two core functionalities: a simple rental process
          and an efficient system for reporting car-related issues. Hereâ€™s how
          the solution was implemented:

        <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-12 ">
